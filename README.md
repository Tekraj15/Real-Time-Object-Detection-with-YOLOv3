# Real-Time-Object-Detection-with-YOLOv3

# Introduction:
In this project we're gonna perform real-time object detection with YOLOv3: a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. Specifically, we will detect objects with the YOLO system using pre-trained models on a GPU-enabled workstation. To apply YOLO to videos and save the corresponding labelled videos, we will build a custom command-line application in Python that employs a pre-trained model to detect, localize, and classify objects. It will use OpenCV to read the video streams, draw bounding boxes around detected objects, label the objects along with confidence scores, and save the labelled videos to disk.
# Project Overview:
Perform real-time object detection with YOLOv3

Use pre-trained models to perform real-time and passive inference with a GPU

Use OpenCV to manipulate video data and develop a command line application with Python for inference
